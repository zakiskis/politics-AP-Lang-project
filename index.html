                    <h3>Seva Merica: A Leader from Oklahoma</h3>
                    <p>My name is Seva Merica, and I intend on doing just that. I grew up in the fine state of Oklahoma — home to farmers, businesspeople, everyday workers, and families. I find myself distressed about the current state of the country. Our fundamental liberties, which the founding fathers promised us so many years ago, are being infringed upon.</p>

                    <p>Woke liberals are ripping away our Second Amendment rights that we have been endowed with for centuries. States in our country are phasing out one of our most prized flavors, the beloved Red 40, just to further their atrocious agenda. The obesity epidemic is out of hand, and the look of the American people is totally worsening our image, proving the need for increased funding for GLP-1s.</p>

                    <p>Worst of all, homelessness is a huge problem in our country. When I was a young child, my family and I vacationed on the wonderful island of Turks and Caicos. We arrived back home to suburban Tulsa only to see dozens of squatters stationed in my home, and many homeless people camped out on my front lawn. It hurts my heart to see these people in need struggling to find a home.</p>

                    <p><strong>Believe me when I tell you that you can count on me, Seva Merica, to save America!</strong></p>

                <h3>Olympic Crisis: A New Path Forward</h3>
                <p class="lead-text">Following the Olympic cheating scandal where many American athletes were caught, it's time for a bold new direction. You know what a real "scandal" is? Radical liberal democrat scammers are opening up fraudulent daycares in Minnesota. Please.</p>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    <p>"If you have the resources to make yourself a better person, why not optimize yourself? I love optimizing myself. I like to apply myself to this country, as well. I will optimize our country."</p>
                </div>

                <p>We just learned that some brave Olympians are standing up for what they believe. I agree with them. If you're not optimizing yourself, you're not trying hard enough, and you will fall behind those who do. As a country, we want to be number one. To do that, we will do anything we can, including what some may call "unnatural" strategies.</p>

                <p>We want to make America great, just like how Olympic athletes can make their performances great. This goes hand-in-hand with many of my policies. You all know about my outspoken beliefs on Ozempic, because I fully believe we need to Make America Look Great Again. Just like how we need American athletes to Perform Great Again.</p>

                <div class="scripture-quote">
                    <p><strong>Romans 12:2:</strong> "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."</p>
                </div>

                <p>In order to make progress, we need to use every last resource. Only woke liberal snowflakes would call this a "scandal." To me, this is only displaying America's strength and impressive resourcefulness.</p>

                <div class="enhanced-games-highlight">
                    <h4>The Enhanced Games Initiative</h4>
                    <p>ESPN recently launched the Enhanced Games, where athletes are allowed to use any and all assets to their fullest potential. <strong>I plan to increase my funding to this glorious program.</strong> I encourage progress and growth, and doping does just exactly that.</p>
                </div>
